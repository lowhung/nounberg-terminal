# Nounberg Terminal

A real‑time Nouns DAO auction tracker that **indexes** on‑chain events, **enriches** them with off‑chain context, produces concise human‑readable headlines, and serves both a paginated REST feed and a live WebSocket stream—all bootstrapped by a single `make start`.

## 📂 Data Model

All events reside in a single **`auction_events`** table keyed by the \*\*on‑chain \*\***`event_id`** (transaction hash + log index, exposed by Ponder as `event.id`).  Columns:

| column            | type        | purpose                          |
| ----------------- | ----------- | -------------------------------- |
| `event_id`        | text PK     | deterministic unique id from log |
| `event_type`      | enum        | `created`, `bid`, `settled`      |
| `block_timestamp` | timestamptz | used for cursor pagination       |
| `headline`        | text        | human string                     |
| …                 | …           | other enrichment fields          |

**Why denormalise?**

* The feed is consumed chronologically; explicit columns (many nullable) avoid costly joins or unions.
* Cursor pagination using `block_timestamp DESC, event_id DESC` remains stable even while new rows stream in.
* Updates are simple `UPDATE … WHERE event_id = ?`—no race with inserts.

If analytical or relational queries grow, a normalised shadow schema or materialised view can be built without touching the hot path.

**Indexes in use**  (defined via Ponder):

* `block_timestamp` (single‑column) — drives cursor pagination.
* `type`, `nounId` (single‑column) — quick filters in the REST endpoint.
* Compound indexes: `(type, block_timestamp)`, `(nounId, block_timestamp)`, `(type, nounId, block_timestamp)` — cover the common “show bids for noun #721” and similar queries.

Full schema lives in `packages/indexer/ponder/schema.ts`; trimmed here for readability.

## 🗄️ Caching Strategy & Lock Management

| Item          | TTL                                                                                   | Lock Key Example        |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| ENS name      | 48 h                                                                                  | `lock:ens:0xd8dA6B…`    |
| ETH/USD price | ≤ 1 h old → **24 h TTL**<br>1 h – 24 h old → **7 d TTL**<br>＞ 24 h old → **30 d TTL** | `lock:price:<hour-iso>` |

Workers acquire a **Redis `SETNX` lock** before external look‑ups; the first worker populates the cache, others read the cached value—eliminating duplicate calls without heavy coordination.

> **Future optimisation:** `SETNX` is simple but single‑instance. For multi‑node resilience we could switch to a [Redlock](https://redis.io/docs/interact/locks/)‑style algorithm or use a small Lua script that performs “get or fetch then set” atomically.

---

## 🔄 End‑to‑End Flow

1. **Detect** — Indexer writes base row keyed by `event_id`.
2. **Enqueue** — Job submitted to BullMQ.
3. **Lock & Fetch** — Worker locks ENS/price keys and fetches as needed.
4. **Update** — Worker `UPDATE`s row with enrichment (no UPSERT needed because row already exists).
5. **Notify** — `NOTIFY auction_events` with `event_id`.
6. **Broadcast** — API pushes JSON to WebSocket clients; REST reflects immediately.

* `nounId` — optional filter

Returns newest‑first events; exact JSON schema is documented inline in code.

### WebSocket `/ws`

```jsonc
// Client → Server
{ "type": "subscribe", "filters": { "nounId": 721 } }

// Server → Client
{ "type": "event", "data": { /* event object */ } }
```

### Health Endpoints

```
GET /api/health        # API liveness
GET /queue/health      # Queue & worker pool
```

## 🧪 Testing with Foundry

Top‑level `make test` orchestrates:

1. **start‑anvil** — mainnet fork.
2. **deploy** — deploys test contracts + simulates auction.
3. **test‑ponder** — asserts indexer/worker output.

Makefile snippets are included below for reference.

## 🧠 Architectural Notes & Take‑aways

### Blockchain Tooling

* **Foundry (Forge + Anvil)** delivers quick, repeatable mainnet‑fork tests—something absent in Cardano’s tool‑chain and a huge velocity boost when validating complex auction flows.
* **Open ABIs (Etherscan, Sourcify)** mean event signatures and calldata layouts are one search away, so log‑decoding and debugging are markedly faster than in ecosystems where contract interfaces are opaque.

### Service Boundaries

* **Dedicated API vs Indexer**  — REST/WebSocket traffic runs in its own process while chain ingestion remains isolated; this separation simplifies scaling decisions (CPU for workers, I/O for API) and keeps failure domains narrow.
* **Worker isolation**  — Enrichment is CPU‑bound and parallel‑friendly; running it in a discrete container group lets Kubernetes HPA scale based on queue depth without impacting request latency on the API.

### Internal Communication

* **Why gRPC (future)**  — Strongly‑typed protobuf contracts and efficient streaming are ideal once service count grows.  Drawbacks: schema evolution rules (append‑only fields) and CI plumbing to regenerate types.  REST is fine for the current two‑hop topology, but a migration path is planned.

### Real‑Time Delivery

* **PostgreSQL LISTEN/NOTIFY** ensures notifications fire only after the row is committed—no dual‑write race that sometimes occurs with Redis Pub/Sub.
* **WebSocket in Hono vs dedicated gateway** — Hono’s WS support works but needs explicit upgrade handling. For production, a separate realtime service (Fastify, native `ws`, uWebSockets.js) would simplify long‑lived connection management and keep the REST layer stateless.
* **Stateful connections** — The API process currently holds all active WebSocket clients in memory.  That works for a single‑instance PoC, but horizontal scaling would require either sticky sessions **or** an external broker (e.g., Redis Pub/Sub, NATS) so any replica can broadcast to all clients.
* WebSocket chosen over SSE for bidirectional features (future auth/filter commands).  Rate‑limiting and per‑user filters are on the roadmap.

### Upsert vs Update

* **Current flow:** Indexer performs the **insert** via Ponder’s **Store API**, which buffers writes in‑memory during historical sync and flushes them to PostgreSQL with COPY—very fast and automatically re‑org‑safe. Workers then issue **raw SQL `UPDATE`s** to append enrichment.  This avoids contention: the component that understands chain rollbacks is the only process that inserts rows.
* **Why not use Store API in workers?**  Store API is optimised for append‑only patterns; enrichment queries need conditional logic and might run outside the Ponder context.  Raw SQL keeps transaction boundaries explicit and straightforward.
* **Upsert option:** If ingestion ever becomes multi‑path (e.g., additional indexers or back‑fill services) we could adopt `INSERT … ON CONFLICT (event_id) DO UPDATE`.  It would simplify worker logic but slightly dilutes the separation of concerns.
* **Future improvement:** Wrap the worker’s raw SQL updates in a thin helper that mimics Store API semantics (or switch to Ponder’s DB client) for consistency and to inherit automatic type‑mapping.

### Observability

* **Prometheus metrics** already exposed by Indexer and Queue/Worker; dashboards live under `monitoring/`.  API metrics will be added after the WebSocket refactor.
* **Structured logging** — Plan to extract a shared `@nounberg/logger` (pino wrapper, similar to Ponder’s internal logger) so every service outputs JSON logs with trace/context fields, making aggregation in Loki or Elasticsearch straightforward.

## 🔮 Future Work

* **EIP‑4361 (Sign‑In with Ethereum)** for authenticated WebSocket streams.
* Migrate internal REST to **gRPC**.
* Implement request‑level **rate‑limiting** once auth is in place.
* Extract shared libs (`@nounberg/logger`, types, SQL) into workspace package.
* Seed full historical ETH price table or run internal oracle.
